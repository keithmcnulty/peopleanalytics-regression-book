### Notes on data used in this book {-}

`r if (knitr::is_html_output()) {'For R, Python and Julia'} else {'For R and Python'}` users, each of the data sets used in this book can be downloaded individually by following the code in each chapter.  Alternatively, packages containing all the data sets used in this book are now available in R and Python.  For R users, install and load the `peopleanalyticsdata` R package.  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install peopleanalyticsdata package
install.packages("peopleanalyticsdata")
library(peopleanalyticsdata)

# see a list of data sets
data(package = "peopleanalyticsdata")

# find out more about a specific data set ('managers' example)
help(managers)
```

For Python users , use `pip install peopleanalyticsdata` to install the package into your environment. Then, to use the package:

```{python, eval = FALSE}
# import peopleanalyticsdata package
import peopleanalyticsdata as pad
import pandas as pd

# see a list of data sets
pad.list_sets()

# load data into a dataframe
df = pad.managers()

# find out more about a specific data set ('managers' example)
pad.managers().info()

```
