## Adjustments since last copy submission

* *xiv*:  Added brief biography for Alexis Fink as recommended by David Grubbs
* *85 (last paragraph) - 86 (first three bullets)*:  some adjustment for clarity
* *129-139*:  Two variables in the Chapter 6 example have been renamed:  `children` renamed to `household` and `tenure` renamed to `absent`.  This results in small changes to text and model output accordingly.
